# Flashcard

A simple vibe coded flashcard app for Android. I made this because I was sick of the NotebookLM flashcards view but stil wanted to use them.

## Features

### Flashcard Set Management
- **Create** new flashcard sets with custom names
- **Import** existing flashcard sets from CSV files (You can export NotebookLM flashcards as CSV and import them here)
- **Delete** sets
- **Rename** sets

### Card Editing
- Add new question/answer pairs to your sets
- Edit existing cards
- Delete cards you no longer need

### Study Mode
- View your flashcards
- **Tap** on a card to flip between question and answer
- Navigate between cards using arrow buttons

### Flexible Storage
- Store flashcard sets in internal app storage (default)
- Choose a custom storage location (e.g., cloud-synced folder)
- Easily backup and sync your flashcards across devices

### CSV Format Support
The app uses standard CSV format for flashcard data:
```csv

```
